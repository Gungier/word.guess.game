        <p><strong>Directions:</strong>  Use the letter keys on the keyboard to guess the name of a cartoon show.  Remember, some cartoons are more than one word and spaces count.  Capital and lowercase letters for some reason are read differently *\./* (still trying to figure out how to fix that.  Symbols will not be used (i.e. & = and).  Press any key to begin and have fun!</p>
